# About

Hello, I'm Jof.

I'm an engineering manager and software engineer.

I've been coding since the '90s, full time since '06, React since 2013, React Native since 2017. Been around the block but continue to dabble in new things that interest and excite me. Which is many things!

I have a slightly strange history involving nuclear reactor inspection robots, Russian space craft, motorsport, fuel injection systems and a couple of startups. You can find out more on my site below.
